# dnd_statblock_wizard
A small tool to create simple but useful statblocks for my dnd game.
Still needs a lot of work, right now its main use it to create stat blocks with a specified CR, while optionally locking certain stats eg SBB.make_statblock_basic(5, {'hp': 20}) returns a statblock with CR 5 and hp 20.
